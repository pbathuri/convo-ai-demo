# Convo AI

Convo AI is a **Streamlit** application for practicing domain-specific conversations with an LLM. It combines Duolingo-style progression visuals, skill tracking, emotional “radar” feedback, optional voice input/output, streaks and XP, and pluggable **domain modules** (political science, business, debate, philosophy, and more).

**Repository:** [github.com/pbathuri/convo-ai-demo](https://github.com/pbathuri/convo-ai-demo)

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pbathuri/convo-ai-demo.git
cd convo-ai-demo
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # add OPENAI_API_KEY
streamlit run app/app.py
```

Run the last command from the **repository root** so `data/` paths work.
